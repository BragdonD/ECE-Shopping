# Views Folder

This folder contains the Java classes that represent the views in the JavaFX application.

## What is a view?

In the context of a JavaFX application, a view is a user interface component that is displayed to the user. A view can be a simple component, such as a button or label, or it can be a more complex component, such as a form or table.

## Java class for a view

Each view in the JavaFX application is represented by a Java class. This class contains the logic for the view and defines how the view should be displayed to the user.

Typically, a view class extends the ``javafx.scene.Parent`` class, which represents a node in the JavaFX scene graph. The view class is responsible for creating the user interface components that make up the view and arranging them in the scene graph.

## Conclusion

The views folder contains the Java classes that represent the user interface components in a JavaFX application. Each view class defines the logic for the view and is responsible for creating and arranging the user interface components.
