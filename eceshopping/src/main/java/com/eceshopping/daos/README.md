# DAOs Folder

This folder contains the Java classes that represent the data access objects (DAOs) in the JavaFX application.

## What is a DAO?

In the context of a JavaFX application, a DAO is a class that is responsible for interacting with the database to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the data.

## Java class for a DAO

Each DAO in the JavaFX application is represented by a Java class. This class contains the logic for the DAO and defines how the application should interact with the database.

Typically, a DAO class uses a database API, such as JDBC, to connect to the database and perform the necessary operations. The DAO may define methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the database.

The DAO class may also define methods for querying the database and returning data in a specific format, such as a list of objects.

## Conclusion

The DAOs folder contains the Java classes that represent the data access objects in a JavaFX application. Each DAO class defines the logic for interacting with the database and is responsible for performing CRUD operations on the data.
