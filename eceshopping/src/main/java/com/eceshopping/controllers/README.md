# Controller Folder

This folder contains the Java classes that represent the controllers in the JavaFX application.

## What is a controller?

In the context of a JavaFX application, a controller is a class that is responsible for handling user input and updating the view accordingly. The controller typically interacts with the view and the model to implement the application logic.

## Java class for a controller

Each controller in the JavaFX application is represented by a Java class. This class contains the logic for the controller and defines how the view and model should interact.

Typically, a controller class implements the ``javafx.fxml.Initializable`` interface, which provides a method called initialize that is called after the view is loaded. In the initialize method, the controller can set up event handlers and initialize the state of the view.

The controller may also define methods that are called by the view to perform actions or update the state of the model.
