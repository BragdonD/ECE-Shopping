# Services Folder

This folder contains the Java classes that represent the services in the JavaFX application.

## What is a service?

In the context of a JavaFX application, a service is a class that is responsible for providing a higher-level abstraction of the application logic. The service typically interacts with the models and the controllers to implement the application logic.

## Java class for a service

Each service in the JavaFX application is represented by a Java class. This class contains the logic for the service and defines how the controllers and models should interact.

Typically, a service class defines methods for performing higher-level operations related to the domain objects. For example, a ProductService may provide methods for adding, updating, and deleting products from the database.

The service class may also define methods for querying the database and returning data in a specific format, such as a list of objects.

## Conclusion

The services folder contains the Java classes that represent the services in a JavaFX application. Each service class provides a higher-level abstraction of the application logic related to the domain object and is responsible for interacting with the models and the controllers to implement the application logic.
