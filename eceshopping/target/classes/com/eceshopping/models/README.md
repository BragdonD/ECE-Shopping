# Models Folder

This folder contains the Java classes that represent the models in the JavaFX application.

## What is a model?

In the context of a JavaFX application, a model is a class that represents a domain object, such as a user, product, or order. The model typically contains the data and logic related to the domain object.

## Java class for a model

Each model in the JavaFX application is represented by a Java class. This class contains the data and logic related to the domain object and defines how the application should interact with the data.

Typically, a model class defines fields for the data associated with the domain object and methods for manipulating and accessing the data.

The model class may also define methods for performing business logic related to the domain object, such as calculating discounts or validating input.

## Conclusion

The models folder contains the Java classes that represent the domain objects in a JavaFX application. Each model class defines the data and logic related to the domain object and is responsible for providing a structured representation of the data to the rest of the application.
